* Coversheets – Requested Changes 11.18.16

** Miscellaneous
*** DONE Mobile-responsive front-page
- The login page is currently cut off on mobile devices, almost unusable. Let's make it better!
- Note taken on [2017-07-10 Mon 19:35] \\
  The login form will now adjust its size relative to the screen size
  of the user that is trying to login.
**** TODO Merge with master
**** TODO Push to production

** Pictures
*** TODO Go to select a few to email out of the album
    - What does this mean exactly?
      
*** TODO Search is not detailed enough – cannot find job / folder
    Example Jennifer Garcia

*** TODO Need Time/Date stamp albums 
    - This would be pretty easy with a new field

*** DONE Need Name of employee that uploaded the album 
  - This would be pretty easy with a new field
  - Note taken on [2017-07-10 Mon 19:46] \\
    Added a created_by field that will automatically be populated
    with the user that creates the album.

**** TODO Functionality handling tables in current production database?
**** TODO Merge with master
**** TODO Push to production

*** TODO Need drop down of “type” of album
- Emergency
- Inspection
- Recon
- Progress
- Completion
    - This would be pretty easy with a new field
*** TODO Need more convenient way to pull out of coversheet
    - What does this mean exactly?
*** TODO Keep description box
    - What does this mean exactly?
** Reports 
*** TODO Glitch – have to get out of section and back into reports to run a 2nd report
    - Need to come up with repro steps for this

*** TODO Weekly production list example
    - What does this mean exactly?

*** TODO Ability to choose a specific Group By & Sort By type 
    Ex. How many CSAA jobs did we get from DKI last year?

*** TODO Need to sort by 2nd loss type with sub-total
    Ex. How many Fires did we get from Alacrity over the last 6 months?

*** TODO Add % complete to date & estimated completion date to coversheet for use in weekly reports
    - How does the % get tracked? Is it automatic or manually entered?
    - Is the estimated completion date automatic or manually entered?

*** TODO Need a De-activate Adjusters feature
*** TODO De-active employees removes their access from the system, but also removes their name from all jobs they worked on.. 
*** TODO Item Added – use Esc key on the keyboard to go back to the previous screen when browsing coversheets
** On the Coversheets page, where the jobs are listed:
*** TODO Add “last 30 days” as a drop down choice in the “Entry Date” section.
*** TODO Auto-Hide the jobs that are in “Declined” status. With the ability to “show declined jobs” which would normally be hidden in the list.
*** TODO Add the “% complete” as a column on the list. Can replace “State” ?
*** TODO He would like to re-arrange the “Add Job” screen as well. In this order:
- Customer info at the top
- Loss Location
- Insurance
- Contact
- Call Data
- Assignments
- Last Update
- Created by
- Albums
*** TODO Erick would like the new coversheets to automatically be put to the “new “ status when entered.
Then after saved, you would be able to go back in and assign an estimator and change the status.
** Contact requirements
*** TODO Remove the requirement to enter a primary phone number in the Contact section. And remove the requirement to check the “Same as loss address” box
And he would like this “Production Snapshot” report easily accessible. This would include:
  - Customer 
  - Value 
  - % complete 
And this is sorted by Super.
